# Advanced Mechatronics – Lab Projects

This repository contains my lab projects for an **Advanced Mechatronics** course.  
Each week, we built and programmed different electronic systems while learning how to integrate sensors, actuators, and embedded software into complete mechatronic devices.

The code and schematics here cover a variety of components, including:

- DC motors and motor drivers  
- LEDs and basic digital I/O  
- Analog-to-Digital Conversion (ADC)  
- Accelerometers and IMUs  
- Servos and position control  
- (And other components introduced throughout the course)
